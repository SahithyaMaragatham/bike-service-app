### Example Use Case
John owns a bike service station where he provides the following services:
- General service check-up
- Oil change
- Water wash

John's customers can register for an account using their email address and mobile number. They can choose a service and book it for a particular date. Once a customer books a service, John receives an email notification with the details of the service requested by the customer.

Once the service is completed, John marks the booking as "ready for delivery," and the customer receives an email notification. When the bike is delivered, John marks the booking as "completed."
